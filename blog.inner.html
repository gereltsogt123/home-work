          Writing UX copies can be a little frustrating and confusing, and
          sometimes we are unsure about how to get the right word. To crack the

          UXWriter and has a set of UX copies cataloged and categorized with a
          voice and tone variation ranging from plain, casual to playful. The
          intention to build this Figma plugin originated from our Medium blog
